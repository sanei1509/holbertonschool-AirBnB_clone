## We create a shell to manage our AirBnB objects.

This is the first step in creating our first full web application: the ``AirBnB clone``

## What’s a command interpreter (shell)?

It is a program that receives commands from a user,
our console has the following functions:



- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
